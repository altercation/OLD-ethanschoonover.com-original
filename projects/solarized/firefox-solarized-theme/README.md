# Zen Fox

As we spend more and more of our lives computing, and more and more of our computing is done on the browser, our browser being the awesome Firefox — it must be themed appropriately for its heavy duty.

Zen Fox uses the stunning Solarized Theme, ported to Firefox using it's latest APIs. That means browser menus like the hamburger and overflow are themed to suit the rest of your browser.

Methods:

Choose from 3 different methods to switch between Dark & Light Themes:

* Manual — toolbar button to switch themes upon press
* Time — change themes automatically at times of your choice
* Weather — update theme based on current cloudiness at your locale


Also, you can now choose the accent color, that is used for your tab line, tab loading, and icon attention colors.

Permissions:

* Theme — to… theme
* Alarm — to set internal timers that check for weather/time updates
* Storage — to store your settings
